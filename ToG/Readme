Ê¥¶÷´«Ëµ Tales of Graces

Met some problem on cpk packing. We've tried some tools that can be download from internet, such as cpkmakec, cpk_replace(from cpk_unpack),but faild, causes infinite loading. Probably was a problem at data compressing(the version of cpkmakec is too old, and cpk_replace just replace the compressed data with uncompressed data). We are trying study the cpk files to find if there is a solution.
